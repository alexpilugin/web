						The name needs simply no introduction. Yes, mention is being made of that handsome hunk, voted 'The sexiest man' alive by People Magazine in 1989. 
						He is that kind of an actor who is the heartthrob of almost all the generations existing. 
						But it took a lot of his efforts to come to this position from the very start. Sex symbol Sean Connery however made it possible to be known as what he is today. 
						His journey was quite an adventurous one and full of struggle, which ultimately led him to the highest peak of stardom from a mere laborer.<br /><br />
						Sean Connery happened to come from a working class family and probably that gave him the drive to move upwards and more. 
						His father was a truck driver and mother, a cleaning woman. No wonder getting their food was an everyday affair. 
						Young Sean also had to contribute to his family working as a milkman, delivering newspaper and even as a butcher's assistance. 
						Sean joined the navy after his school days and later he participated in the Mr. Universe and stood 3rd. 
						Sean got a role in the chorus line of the London stage production of South Pacific in 1952 for his wonderful physique. 
						He got his first break in the remake of an American tele-drama ‘Requiem for a Heavyweight' after which he never had to look back.

				<h3 class="textSubTitle">Bond, James Bond</h3>
					<p class="text">
					
						Connery got the blasting role of James bond in the year 1962 and his performance was just mind blowing. 
						This affable young man was so much suited to the role of a private detective agent with all his wit and charms that till date we cannot think of James Bond without him... 
						Of his 007 films mention may be made of “From Russia With Love”, “Thunderball”, “Goldfinger” and “You Only Love Twice”. 
						But this versatile genius did not let that tag stick to him forever. He took up more varied roles and they proved to be quite challenging.
